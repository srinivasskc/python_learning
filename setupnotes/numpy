NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

NumPy = Numerical Python.

Installation:
Step 1: CMD - python
Step 2: CMD - pip install numpy

Verification:
Step 3: import numpy

Project URL: https://pypi.org/project/numpy/

Uninstall:
Step 4: pip uninstall numpy

Notes:
a. numpy's most useful feature is - n dimentional array object.
b. Benefits of numpy array over a python list.
- Less Memory
- Fast
- Convenient
c. Can be treated as replacement to matlab.
d. numpy is extremely faster 30 times than python list.
e. When we create a numpy array it's been stored in a continuous blocks of memory
f. Optimized for recent computer architecture.
g. Useful when working on linear algebra, matrix operations, fourier transformation.

Three-Dimensional Matrix will be useful when you are going to learn deep learning or image recognition
